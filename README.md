What will it take to make a versatile computer use agent that can safely and effectively handle any task? 🤖

This is a collection of resources and ideas towards this goal.

## 1. Overview of Tasks and Features

The Open Operator project aims to enable AI agents to perform a wide range of computer tasks across several key domains:

- **Development**: Code generation, project setup, version control 💻
- **Data Management**: Processing, analysis, and synchronization 📊
- **Automation**: Workflows, emails, customer support 🤖
- **Web Interaction**: Navigation, form filling, research 🌐
- **System Operations**: File management, software installation, monitoring 🖥️

For a detailed breakdown of tasks and capabilities, see [capabilities.md](capabilities.md).

## 2. Benchmarks

- [WebArena](benchmarks/webarena.md) is a realistic web environment for building autonomous agents. 🌐
- [OSWorld](benchmarks/osworld.md) is a scalable, real computer environment for multimodal agents that supports task setup, execution-based evaluation, and interactive learning across operating systems 🖥️.
